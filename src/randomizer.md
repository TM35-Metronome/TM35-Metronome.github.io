The Metronome Randomizer is a rom randomizer built on top of [Metronome](/index.html).
This tool works as a frontend for the user to run several commands on
a Pokémon rom. Each command will modify the game in some way, and each
command has options that can be adjusted. All options can also be saved,
shared and loaded back up.

The Randomizer is also extendible with custom commands, that can be
written in any programming language.
